# What is a Code of Conduct?

A Code of Conduct (CoC) is a document that defines what a community finds acceptable and not acceptable.
It defines a community's shared values explicitly.
Without a CoC a community still has shared values and ways of interacting, but they are not written down.

A CoC should define:

1. What is expected behavior
2. What is unacceptable behavior
3. How to report problems
4. How to handle problems

## OSS license analogy

A CoC is a document much like an open source license.
Without a license, a project defaults to an implicit license.
Similarly, without a CoC, a community defaults to implicitly acceptable and unacceptable behaviors and remedies.

Just as there are many kinds of OSS licenses, there are many kinds of CoCs.
As they reflect their communities, they are very diverse and have varied purposes and intents.
For example, the [MIT license][MITLicense] basically says "do whatever you want with this software, I won't help or hinder you".
The [GPL license][GPLLicense] on the other hand subverts copyright to promote open source ideology (copyleft). CoCs can be the same way.

## Enforcement of a CoC

Defining what is unacceptable behavior is not useful without a way to report and handle problems.
It is just as well to say "don't kill people" but without enforcement the only thing stopping individuals is their own morals.
We know from history that people have diverse personal morals, and some believe that killing others is not a problem.
With enforcement we define a community.

## Common elements of CoCs

<research needed. Why promote specific attributes of people? Why address identity?>
